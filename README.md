# workflows

I believe that a good workflow is important. If you're able to find a way to become more efficient, you should create a system to help you work smarter, not harder. As a developer, it is important for me to document a lot of my work. Every day, I comment on my ticket about the progress. When we create a new project, I document the essentials someone would need to either work on the same project or QA my work. 

Templates are a great way to efficiently write tasks. They make sure you have all the information you need before you start work. They can also help you create a step-by-step list of items to complete that tasks. 

I am sharing my workflows because it not only helped me, but the team as well to create better product features.
