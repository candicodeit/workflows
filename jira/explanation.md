# Jira Workflows

## Ticket Writing
When you write a ticket, you as a developer or designer want to know all the context in order to approach the task in the correct manner. We originally had a general ticket template, which was great for some development tasks.

However, we needed something that fit better to the requirements of an A/B Test. I created this ticket template to help define what's necessary to create an A/B test:

The listed items within brackets generated a dropdown when you first created a ticket. This made it easier to define certain areas with common answers vs having to type it in every time. The ticket template continues to evolve, as needed. I also listed the [design template](https://github.com/candicodeit/workflows/blob/master/jira/design-test-ticket-template.md). 

## Comments
Comments within tickets is usually any conversations about the tasks or updating the progress of a ticket. For an A/B testing perspective, I created a [Comments Template](https://github.com/candicodeit/workflows/blob/master/jira/ticket-comments-checklist.md) to help write out steps to complete my task. I also include the steps to browser check and setup any test metrics.
